- 2003-09-18, version 1.1.8 (Kevin Kofler)
        * Patches by Nils Gesbert:
          - completely removed -8 and -9 flags.
          - fixed various buffer overflow and shell metacharacter bugs.
        * Removed obsolete handling of -bsr flag. (It already had no effect.)

- 2002-11-30, version 1.1.7 (Kevin Kofler)
        * Removed documentation of -8 and -9 flags, because they only apply when
          the linker supports them, which is not the case with obj2ti.
        * tigcc -E now works as documented.
        * tigcc -g now deletes tempfile.o (unless -keep is specified as well).

          files with a .c.??z double-extension.
        * Added support for a $TIGCC/include/s GNU assembly include directory.
        * Now escaping arguments passed to GCC in order to allow -D switches
          with definitions containing spaces or other shell metacharacters.

- 2002-09-17, version 1.1.5 (Kevin Kofler)
        * Allowing --standalone and --outputbin as synonyms for -standalone and
          -outputbin.

        * Implemented -keep, --keep, -save-temps and --save-temps switches.
        * Now deleting object files by default (to match the behavior of the
          Windows version). Use -keep if you want to keep them.
