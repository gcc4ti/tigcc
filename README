			| TIGCC-FRONTEND FOR LINUX |
			+--------------------------+




Foreword from the packager
--------------------------

	This program is a port of tigcc.exe, a Win32 program written in Delphi
	by Sebastian Reichelt. It has been written from scratch in C language.

	It should have the same behavior as the original.

Usage
-----

	This program is a front end for TIGCC: it will automatically call the
	necessary programs to compile everything you pass to it in the command
	line.

	John and Romain have written this program so that Windows users have a
	similar environment under Linux, but also for easily recompiling source
	code which has been developed under Windows.

	You should use ONLY this frontend or tprbuilder to compile TIGCC
	projects. Makefile hacks to directly use TIGCC components like gcc, as,
	patcher, ... are NOT supported and will probably NOT work.

Examples
--------

	You will find some examples in the tt and extgraph directories.
	You will find also a lot of examples in the different source packages
	available on Internet (more particularly www.ticalc.org).

	Simple file:
		tigcc -O2 -Wall HelloW.c (default: HelloW.89z)
	or	tigcc -O2 -Wall HelloW.c -o foo (change to foo.89z)

	Multiple files:
		tigcc -O2 -Wall defs.c func-ti.c rpscript.c stdio-f.c sys.c
		str.c  patches.c rpshash.c submalloc.c tiscript.c -o myvar

	Simple file against an archive:
		tigcc -O3 -Wall -W -fomit-frame-pointer demo1.c extgraph.a

	Simple file but compressed:
		tigcc -O2 ebook.c -pack ebookppg
